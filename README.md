Supports the art of argumentation

## Idea
An argument, in terms of a dispute, consists of various arguments, in terms of a point. Software could help to find the most trueish aspect of an argument, by divding an argument statement to subarguments and let users judge whether the subarguments, and maybe its recursion, meaning the subarguments of the subarguments and so on, are trueish. 
By this an argument statement can be judged by judging its consisting argument points and for many contraverial arguments a process could be elaborated, that helps to find the most true aspect of an issue.

Emotion is the hardest opponent of such a system, but by applying certain rules, emotion, harming the objective discurse, could be tightened, such that emotional topics could be handled in a most possible objective way.

## Technology
To start with, a single page application with Angular will be set up to showcase how arguments can be divided into subarguments and how it could be votet on those subarguments in order to find a most trueish answer for the original argument.

## Vision
With blockchain technology, the rules for a fair and objective discurs, could be distributed to different servers across the world, such that consensus of those could be made in a shared and maybe anonymous way. The distributed technology could also help to enable freedom of speech under the distributed and democratically chosen rules.

## Purpose
The purpose is to help people to find trueish answers to problems in our society, by supporting the idea, that a trueish argument consinst of trueish subarguments.
